    Comprehensive definition of the manufacturing procedure and material:

    1. Material Selection:
       - Aerospace-grade materials, such as advanced aluminum-lithium
         alloys, titanium alloys, or carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers
         (CFRP), are chosen based on weight, strength, and corrosion
         resistance requirements.
       - Composites are often used for fuselage and wing skins to reduce
         weight and increase structural stiffness. Titanium is used in
         high-temperature regions like engine mounts and exhausts.

    2. Material Preparation:
       - Raw materials arrive in the form of sheets, bars, composite
         prepregs, or forgings.
       - They are inspected for defects, measured, and cut or prepared
         according to design specifications.

    3. Precision Machining:
       - Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining is used to mill or
         lathe metal components to exact tolerances.
       - Operators monitor the process, performing inspections to ensure
         dimensional accuracy. This may include the shaping of internal
         support structures, formers, and bulkheads.

    4. Composite Layup and Curing:
       - For CFRP parts, layers of fiber cloth are laid onto molds
         according to the design's ply schedule.
       - The layup is vacuum-bagged and cured in an autoclave to achieve
         the necessary strength-to-weight ratios.
       - Cure time can vary, here it's set to the parameter `cure_time_hours`.

    5. Component Assembly:
       - Skilled technicians align fuselage sections, wings, and tail
         surfaces, fastening or bonding them together. Jigs and fixtures
         maintain precision alignment.
       - Welding or fastening is completed with high-integrity methods,
         such as friction stir welding for aluminum-lithium alloys. The
         strength requirement can be around `friction_welding_strength`
         for optimal joint integrity.

    6. Surface Treatment and Finishing:
       - Surfaces are treated with primers, sealants, or corrosion-
         resistant coatings. Certain sections may be painted using a
         radar-absorbent material or specialized coatings.

    7. Quality Control and Testing:
       - Non-destructive testing (NDT), like ultrasonic or X-ray
         inspection, verifies internal structural integrity.
       - Dimensional checks ensure parts conform to CAD models. Testing
         includes load, stress, and aerodynamic assessments.

    8. Final Assembly and System Integration:
       - Landing gear, avionics, propulsion, and control systems are
         integrated into the airframe. Cabling and hydraulic lines are
         routed and secured.
       - Real-world manufacturing requires iterative checks with design
         data, logs, and continuous improvement loops.

    9. Certification and Delivery:
       - Rigorous flight testing and certification processes ensure the
         aircraft meets airworthiness standards.
       - Maintenance documentation and service bulletins are prepared,
         and the finished product is delivered to the operator.

    This thorough sequence covers essential manufacturing steps and
    materials for advanced aerospace products like the F-35 class
    aircraft, ensuring each stage adheres to strict safety and
    performance criteria.
